# App
changed some content from preious version<br>
it has a feature in which when a call button is pressed in the contact us page<br>
it directly calls to the defined phone number<br>
the code is <br>
launch("tel:919010590693"),<br>
But for the call to proceed +91 is the code<br>
so by using the<b> escape sequence</b> we can add any character in the flutter and in all basic programming languages<br>
The escape Sequence is "/"<br>
  So by using <br>
  launch("tel:/+919010590693"),<br>
  we can add the character<br>
     <br><br>
     <h3>Other Important change<h3><br>
     some apps are desgned for portrait mode <br>
     when they are rotated to landscape mode the screen padding changes and app will look ugly with error of pixels<br>
     so by using this cod ein the main method of the main.dart file we can eradicate that error<br>
